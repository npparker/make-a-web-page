					<ul>
					<li>HTML is Hyper Markup Language.  It is a document that contains all sort of content but is the basis for everything on the web.
					<li>Your browser makes request that servers reply to with content.  HTTP is the protocol that the browser uses to speak to servers.
					<li>HTML is made up of text content like what I am writing right now.  It is also made up of links to content and markup which is the way a site looks.
					</ul>

					<div>
					<ul>
					<li>Anchor tag is a link tag that is <a href="www.cnn.com"><b>GREAT for checking the NEWS</b></a>
					<li>The Image tag is how you would link image content to the page!!  Image tags are VOID tags so they do not need a closing tag.
					<li>Whitespace - The br tag allows for a line break.  It is also a void tag that does not need a closing tag.
					<li>In comparsion a P tag (paragrah) is not a void tag and requires a closing tag.
					<li>The br tag in considered an inline tage which just breaks the line in comparsion tothe P tag which is a block tag that has an invisible box.
					<li>Inline elements include B em br and even img tags
					<li>Span is an inline element that contains it content.  It allows you to add <span class="foo">style to the content through CSS</span>.
					<li>Div is a block element that contains its content. The div element will create a separate line.

					<ul>
					<li>HTML is the language that adds structure and content to a website whereas CSS is the language that adds style to the site.  For instance CSS and change the font, color, or space of an element on a page. Even if the HTML code is exactly the same on two different pages they can look completely different if the CSS is different.
					</ul>

			<div class="subs">BOXES BOXES!!! and more BOXES
				<div class="body">
					<ul>
					<li>Webpages are broken into boxes.  This even includes elements that do not look rectangle.  You can take any website and start sectioning it out into boxes to understand the layout.  Many times there are boxes inside of boxes.
					</ul>

		<div class="headings1">Lesson Notes 1.3
			<div class="subs">CSS
				<div class="body">
					<ul>
					<li>CSS provides style to different elements inside of HTML.  This includes how elements are sized, colored, and spaced on the page.  CSS can be inserted into a page by writing the code in the “heading”, by linking to a .css file, or by writing the code inline.  For most situations it makes the most sense to link the html to the .css file.
					<li>Each element has the content size which is like the nucleus of an atom.  The padding is the space in the box that protects the content.  Around the content and padding there is the border which is the same color as the content.  Finally surrounding everything else is the margin which is transparent and provides space around the box.
					<li>Sizing each box can be complex so using an automated tag simplifies the process by using box-sizing in CSS code.  The only problem is that older browsers may have issues with box-sizing.
